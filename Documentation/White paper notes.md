Looking at your [[White Paper]], there are several elements that could be added or enhanced to make it more comprehensive and compelling:

1. **Specific Market Research Data**: The "[X] billion by 2025" placeholder needs actual market figures with cited sources to establish credibility.
2. **Technical Details of the MCP Protocol**: While mentioned throughout, there's limited explanation of how the Model Context Protocol actually works technically.
3. **Token Distribution and Initial Offering**: There's no information about the initial token distribution, pre-sale, public offering, team allocation, or vesting schedules.
4. **Risk Analysis Section**: A section addressing potential challenges, risks, and mitigation strategies would strengthen investor confidence.
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Given the cryptocurrency component, a section on regulatory approaches and compliance strategies is essential.
6. **Actual Competitor Analysis**: The competitor sections are placeholders that need real competitor names and detailed comparisons.
7. **Concrete Timeline**: The development roadmap lacks specific timeframes or milestones with dates.
8. **Team Details**: The leadership and advisor sections are empty placeholders that need actual names, backgrounds, and expertise.
9. **Use Cases**: While agents are listed, detailed real-world use cases and examples would make the value proposition more tangible.
10. **Technical Infrastructure Details**: More specifics about the cloud infrastructure, security measures, and scalability approaches.
11. **Visual Elements**: Diagrams, charts, and visual representations of the ecosystem would enhance understanding.
12. **Community and Governance**: More details on how the community will be involved in governance beyond token staking.
