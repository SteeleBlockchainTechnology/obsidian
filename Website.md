# Agentic Website Business Plan

## Overview
We’re building a dope website where people use AI agents (like web browser ones) we create. They’ll need to hold our cryptocurrency and spend tokens to access the agents. It’s cutting-edge, with a slick 3D frontend and a dynamic backend. Me and my brother are splitting the work: I’m on agents, he’s on the website.

---

## Project Goals
- Build an AI agent that connects to all MCP servers (universal access).
- Create a dynamic website with 3D elements for users to interact with agents.
- Tie it to a cryptocurrency (maybe Solana or BNB) for payments.
- Keep it organized and launch fast.

---

## Team Roles
- **Me**: Build the AI agent using MCP.
- **Brother**: Build the website frontend (and later backend) with newbie-friendly tools.

## Development Plan

### Step 1: Setup and Tools
- **What**: Get all the tools we need using NPM (our shopping cart for code).
- **Why**: Sets the foundation for everything else.
- **How**:
  1. Install Node.js on our computers (lets us use NPM).
  2. Make a main folder called `agent-site`.
  3. Inside, create two subfolders: `frontend` and `backend`.
  4. In each subfolder, run `npm init -y` to start a shopping list (package.json).

### Step 2: Frontend Development
- **What**: Build the website people see with React, Vite, and Three.js.
- **Why**: It’s the face of the project, needs to be fast and cool with 3D.
- **Tools**:
  - **React**: Lego blocks for building the screen (buttons, 3D stuff).
  - **Vite**: Speedy chef that cooks the site fast and shows changes live.
  - **Three.js**: Magic wand for 3D graphics (spinning shapes, animations).
- **How**:
  1. In `frontend` folder, run `npm install vite @vitejs/plugin-react react react-dom`.
  2. Add Three.js with `npm install three @react-three/fiber`.
  3. Start a basic Vite project: `npm create vite@latest` (pick React).
  4. Build a simple page with a 3D spinning cube to test Three.js.
  5. Use AI coding tools to help my brother tweak it (like a landing page).

### Step 3: Backend Development
- **What**: Set up the server with Express to make the site dynamic.
- **Why**: Handles requests and will talk to the agent later.
- **Tools**:
  - **Express**: Kitchen guy who takes orders and sends stuff back.
- **How**:
  1. In `backend` folder, run `npm install express`.
  2. Create a file `server.js` with basic code:
     ```javascript
     const express = require('express');
     const app = express();
     app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World'));
     app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running'));
